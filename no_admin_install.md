# Install EcoAssist without admin rights
It's possible to install EcoAssist without admin rights. Actually, the only thing in the normal install requiring admin rights is the git for windows installation. So when you already succesfully installed (the non-admin version of) git prior to installing EcoAssist, it should work without problems.
